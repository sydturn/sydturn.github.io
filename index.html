              <span class="namefont h1">Hey there!</span>
              <p>My name is Sydney. I am a software developer who loves to learn and teach. One of my favorite things that I have had the pleasure of experiencing in my life was running the Computer Science Club at Algoma University for a year. I was able to meet new people, plan all kinds of tech events, and learn a lot! I think that it is super important to start teaching kids how to program when they are young. Programming is so rewarding, and is such a huge part of our tech dominated world. A lot of people (my past-self included) think that learning to program is something completely unattainable, like rocket science; they don't realize that with a little bit of help and practice they too can learn to create amazing things!</p>
              <p>Something interesting about myself is that I initially started off studying law (as you can see from my education). The study of law is super interesting, but I remember in my 4th year of Law I walked into the Computer Science Lab at my University to meet a friend and saw a woman presenting a simple website that she had developed for a class. I was completely amazed that she was able to create something so unique and I thought to myself that it was like a painting that you could interact with. I had told her how amazing she was for making something like that and she responded "oh it's really not that hard" and began to talk a little bit about what developing her website had entailed. I asked the friend I was meeting there to show me how to program and he taught me how to make a simple tip calculator using Python. It was amazing! From then on I was hooked, and the rest is history.</p>
